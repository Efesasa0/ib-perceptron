# Perceptron Classification with Sound Files

- **Summary**: Presented as an IB HL Math IA in 2019 (final project) in high school. The project aims to explore Deep Neural Networks, focusing on the Perceptron to elucidate its mathematical principles.

- **Tools Used**: [List of tools used, e.g., MATLAB, Python, specific libraries or software]

## File Descriptions

1. **`voice_perceptron.m`**: A MATLAB script for training the perceptron model using voice data. It includes functions for processing audio inputs and adjusting weights based on error minimization.

2. **`visualizesounds.m`**: This script provides a visual representation of the sound data used in the perceptron model. It helps in understanding the characteristics of the audio signals being classified.

3. **`createtesting.m`**: A utility script for generating testing datasets from the collected sound files. It formats the data suitable for input into the perceptron model for classification testing.

4. **`Math HL Perceptron IA Final.pdf`**: A comprehensive documentation of the project. It covers the rationale, methodology, results, and conclusions of the perceptron model application in sound classification. Also includes reflections on the learning process and the integration of mathematics in machine learning.
